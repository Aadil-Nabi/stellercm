# On a mission to make the world a better place

At our core, we believe that security and trust are the foundations of a better world. Whether it's safeguarding data or protecting digital identities, our commitment lies in creating solutions that are secure, compliant, and built for the future. We go beyond just deploying technology — we ensure it's aligned with the highest standards and best practices. From rigorous compliance checks to real-time monitoring, our goal is to enable a safer digital ecosystem for everyone.

# Our mission

To uphold the integrity and security of every system we touch. As part of this mission, we ensure that every ** Thales CipherTrust Manager ** deployment is validated against industry best practices and meets all necessary compliance requirements. Our team diligently checks:

Service Configuration & Monitoring: We validate SNMP and system monitoring to ensure proactive visibility into operations. Security Hardening: Password strength policies, encryption (including full disk encryption), and secure domains are audited for robustness. Backup and Recovery: We confirm the status of backup systems, including local and remote backup servers, to ensure disaster readiness. Key Management: Our checks include reviewing cluster status, key states, and encryption health — including CTE (CipherTrust Transparent Encryption) and CCKM (CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager) functionality. System Status & Compliance: A holistic assessment of system health, compliance with organizational policies, and readiness for audits is conducted regularly. Through every deployment and every update, we’re here to ensure not just functionality, but excellence — because a secure system is the first step toward a better, safer world.
